# 🐦 Bird Species Prediction Web App (Django + TensorFlow)

This is a web application that allows users to upload bird images and get predictions of the bird species using a trained TensorFlow model. The application is built using **Django**, with a user-friendly interface and a deep learning model trained on bird species.
